/** \page page_client Client
 *
 * \section sec_page_client_overview Overview
 *
 * The \ref pw_client object is created by a protocol implementation when
 * a new client connects.
 *
 * The client is used to keep track of all resources belonging to one
 * connection with the PipeWire server.
 *
 * \section sec_page_client_credentials Credentials
 *
 * The client object will have its credentials filled in by the protocol.
 * This information is used to check if a resource or action is available
 * for this client. See also \ref page_access
 *
 * \section sec_page_client_types Types
 *
 * The client and server maintain a mapping between the client and server
 * types. All type ids that are in messages exchanged between the client
 * and server will automatically be remapped. See also \ref page_types.
 *
 * \section sec_page_client_resources Resources
 *
 * When a client binds to core global object, a resource is made for this
 * binding and a unique id is assigned to the resources. The client and
 * server will use this id as the destination when exchanging messages.
 * See also \ref page_resource
